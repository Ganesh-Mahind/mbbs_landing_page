## Project Overview

This project is a ReactJS application featuring a dynamic table component built with modern libraries such as Redux Toolkit, React Hook Form, and TanStack React Table (v8). The application allows users to view dummy data in a paginated table (10 entries per page), filter the entire dataset via a global search, and sort each column in both ascending and descending orders. Additionally, the app provides an option to download the data as an Excel file. A form is also included for adding new entries, with robust validation to ensure data integrity. The app is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Dynamic Table**: Displays dummy data with pagination (10 entries per page).
- **Global Filtering**: Allows users to search across all table columns.
- **Sorting**: Enables ascending/descending sorting for each column.
- **Excel Download**: Exports the current dataset (or filtered view) as an Excel file.
- **Form with Validation**: Utilizes React Hook Form to add new entries with input validation (e.g., numeric IDs).
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensures that the table and form are accessible and well-formatted on any device.
